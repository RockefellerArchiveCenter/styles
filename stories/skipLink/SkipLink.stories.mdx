# Skip Link

Use the skip link component to provide quick access to the main content of a page
or view. This allows a person using a keyboard or other assistive technology to
easily bypass globally repeated content like primary navigation or search.

## When to use

All Rockefeller Archive Center web sites must include at least one primary “skip
to main content” link on every page as the first item within the `body` element.

## Best practices

Use the `visually-hidden` class to hide the skip link until it receives user focus.
The skip link target may vary depending on your HTML structure.

## Colors
Skip links can be either blue or orange. Use the `skip-link--blue` and `skip-link--orange` classes.
