# Skip Link

Use the skip link component to provide quick access to the main content of a page
or view. This allows a person using a keyboard or other assistive technology to
easily bypass globally repeated content like primary navigation or search.

## When to use

All Rockefeller Archive Center web sites must include at least one primary “skip
to main content” link on every page as the first item within the `body` element.

## Best practices

The skip link should remain hidden until it receives user focus. The skip link
target may vary depending on your HTML structure.

## Known issues

The color flame-orange does not meet WCAG contrast requirements against the current background.
