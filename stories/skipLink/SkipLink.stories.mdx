# Skip Link

Use the skip link component to provide quick access to the main content of a page
or view. This allows a person using a keyboard or other assistive technology to
easily bypass globally repeated content like primary navigation or search.

## When to use

All Rockefeller Archive Center web sites must include at least one primary “skip
to main content” link on every page as the first item within the `body` element.

## Best practices

The skip link should remain hidden until it receives user focus. The skip link
target may vary depending on your HTML structure.

In order to demonstrate the appearance of the skip link, inline styles are added
to the HTML when the component is toggled to "shown". These styles _should not_
be copied when this component is added to web properties.

## Related components

No related components.

## Known issues

Does not meet WCAG requirements for color contrast.

## Default implementation

The skip link component is hidden by default. To see what it looks like, switch
to the Canvas tab and toggle the "shown" switch.
