# Social Media Icons

Social media icons are links that connect users to the Rockefeller Archive Center's social
media presence.

## When to use

Use on Rockefeller Archive web sites when users should be directed to social media feeds.

## Best practices

- Ensure each link associated with the icon has an `aria-label` attribute.
- Because they are decorative, the icons themselves should be hidden and unfocusable.
