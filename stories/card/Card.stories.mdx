# Card

Cards allow users to quickly browse content of varying types and lengths.

## When to use

Use to display heterogenous content composed of different elements, whose size or
supported actions vary. Allows a collection of multiple data types to be viewed
as a group so that a user can take some action relating to that group.

## Best practices

For accessibility, ensure that card content is placed in the correct reading order.
