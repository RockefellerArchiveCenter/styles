# Badge

Badges are used to highlight brief data elements that do not need labels. You can
easily create a badge by adding a `badge` class to a `span` element.

## Colors
Badges come in blue and orange, which can be produced by adding a `badge--blue`
or `badge--orange` class to the base `badge` class.
