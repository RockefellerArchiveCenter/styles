# Badge

Badges are used to visually highlight brief data elements that do not need labels. You can
easily create a badge by adding a `badge` class to a `span` element.

## When to use

Badges quickly convey information; they are not interactive like a button.

## Best practices

For accessibility, place badges so that they makes sense in reading order. For example, a badge used in a card should come after the card title.

No related components.

## Known issues

No known issues.

## Colors
Badges come in blue and orange, which can be produced by adding a `badge--blue`
or `badge--orange` class to the base `badge` class.
