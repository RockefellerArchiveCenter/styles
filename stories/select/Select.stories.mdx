# Select

Select allows users to make a single selection from a list of options.

## When to use

Use the select component inside a form where users are selecting from a list of
options and submitting data.

## Best practices

- Order your list of options in a way that will make the most sense to the user. This could be:
  - alphabetically
  - numerically
  - by most commonly selected option
- Donâ€™t overwhelm the user with too many options.
- Avoid very long option names to facilitate understandability and perceivability.
- Do not use the same word or phrase at the beginning of a set of options.
- Use a unique id for each option.
- If the select field is required include the `aria-required` property and indicate
  that it is a required field and use the validation message for input errors.
