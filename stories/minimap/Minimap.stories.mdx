# Minimap

A minimap shows the location of hits within a large results set.

## When to use

The minimap is used to help users navigate search results within a collection.

## Best practices
The clickable target size of the minimap boxes have an area of at least 24 by 24
CSS pixels for accessibility.

## Related components

No related components.

## Known issues

No known issues.

## Default implementation

The minimap takes up the entire width and height of the container that wraps it,
although that container size must allow a minimum box width of 24px.

<Story story={stories.basic} />

## Changing the column count

By default, each row of the minimap contains five squares. It is possible to
change this behavior by adding a class which specifies the number of squares
up to 20.

### Ten across (`minimap--10-across`)

<Story story={stories.tenAcross} />

### Twenty across (`minimap--20-across`)

<Story story={stories.twentyAcross} />
