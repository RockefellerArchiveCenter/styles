# Dropdown Menu

A dropdown menu displays a list of actions or options to a user where an action is initiated based on the
selection. Use a button to open and close the dropdown menu.

## When to use

This component can be used for navigation or command menus where there are typically 5 or more items. Use in mobile
contexts when actions are collapsed into a single menu. In cases where users will select one or more
options from a list that do not initiate an action, use the Select component instead.

## Best practices

- Use descriptive item labels so that users understand what selecting the item will do.
- Keep menu items to a single line of text.
- Sort the list in a logical order with the most commonly selected items at the top.
- For mobile site navigation in the header, use an unordered list element with the links as list items, and do not
use the `menu` or `menuitem` aria roles . Refer to the header styles for more details.

## Known issues

The orange background with white text does not meet WCAG requirements for color contrast.

## Basic implementation
Use javascript to enable the button to open and close the dropdown menu. To see what this looks
like, switch to the Canvas tab and toggle the "showDropdownItems" switch.
