# Hero

A hero is a section of a page which draws attention through the use of large
images and text.

## When to use

Use a hero on the home page of a web site in order to quickly convey to users
the purpose of the site and actions that are available to them there.

## Best practices

If the image in the hero is purely decorative, like a logo, it does not need
alt text in the `img` element. Instead, use `alt=""` to indicate a decorative image.

## Image dimensions

the `hero__logo img` selector.
