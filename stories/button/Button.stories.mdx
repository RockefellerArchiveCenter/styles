# Button

A button triggers an event or action. Button labels express what action will
occur when the user interacts with it.

## When to use

Use a button to help users carry out an action like starting an application or
saving their information.

## Best practices

- Button text should describe the action the button performs, for example "Sign
  in", or "Save for later".
- Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the
  desired action is to take the user to a new page.
- Use the base "btn" class in addition to a class which specifies a color or size.

## Known issues

`btn--orange` does not meet WCAG requirements for color contrast.

## Colors
Buttons come in a variety of colors:

<Story story={stories.colors} />

## Sizes
Buttons come in small, medium or large sizes. Use the `btn--sm`, `btn--md` and `btn--lg` classes.

<Story story={stories.sizes} />

## Button icons
You can add an icon before or after the button text.

<Story story={stories.icons} />

## Full-width buttons
By adding a `btn--block` class, you can make a button stretch the full width of its parent element.

<Story story={stories.fullWidth} />

## Link styled as a button
When redirecting users to another page, rather than performing an action like
submitting a form, use a link styled as a button.

<Story story={stories.link} />
