# Table of Contents

A table of contents is a navigation element that helps users quickly jump to a
section of a page.

## When to use

Use on long pages to provide a way for users to quickly scan the page contents
without having to scroll.

## Best practices

Provide a `role=navigation` attribute to indicate the purpose of this element for assistive technology.
