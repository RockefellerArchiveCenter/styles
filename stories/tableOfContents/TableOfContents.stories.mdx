# Table of Contents

A table of contents is a navigation element that helps users quickly jump to a
section of a page.

## When to use

Use on long pages to provide a way for users to quickly scan the page contents
without having to scroll.

## Best practices

Provide a `role=navigation` attribute to indicate the purpose of this element for assistive technology.

Optionally use `class="active"` to indicate when a specific section of contents is visible on the page, if that
functionality is built into the table of contents implementation.

## Known issues

`toc--orange` does not meet WCAG requirements for color contrast.

## Colors
The table of contents comes in a variety of colors. Use the `toc--neutral`,
`toc--blue` and `toc--orange` classes.

<Story story={stories.neutral} />

<Story story={stories.blue} />

<Story story={stories.orange} />

## Adding a title

The table of contents can also have one or more titles to separate sections:

<Story story={stories.withTitle} />
