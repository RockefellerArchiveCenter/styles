# Header

The header shows users that they are on a Rockefeller Archive Center website,
and which service they are using.

## When to use

A version of the header should be used on all Rockefeller Archive Center web properties.

## Best practices

There are a number of variations of the header; see below to select the most
appropriate one for your use case.

## Related components

The header is a layout that consists of Navigation and Dropdown components that are included
together. Button styles are also used for navigation dropdown styles in the header, and Social
Media Icons component is an optional component.

## Known issues

In the header with dropdown items, when the dropdown is open the dropdown buttons in the header move.
It is unclear if this is something that can be fixed in the styles, or is related to Storybook's
rendering.

## Colors

The header comes in white or dark blue themes. Use the `header--white` and `header--blue`
classes.

<Story of={stories.colors} />

## Branding

The header can have either a simple text brand:

<Story of={stories.withTextBrand} />

Or it can use an image in lieu of text. Make sure the image has appropriate `alt` text:

<Story of={stories.withImageBrand} />

## Navigation

The header can contain navigation items. These can be simple links. Use the `header--blue`
class in this case. On small screens, the navigation items are replaced by a button and
with a dropdown that shows the links. To see what this looks like, switch to the Canvas
tab and toggle the "hideMobileNavItems" switch on a mobile view:

<Story of={stories.withNavItems} />

They can also contain dropdown menus for more complex navigation. Use the `header--white`
class in this case. To see what this looks like, switch to the Canvas
tab and toggle the "showDropdownItems" switch on any screensize, and the "showmobileDropdownItems"
on a mobile view. Use javascript to implement the function to show/hide the mobile `id="nav-toggle"` button.

<Story of={stories.withDropdownItems} />

## Social Media Icons

Social media icons can be added to a header as well.
