# Header

The header shows users that they are on a Rockefeller Archive Center website,
and which service they are using.

## When to use

A version of the header should be used on all Rockefeller Archive Center web properties.

## Best practices

There are a number of variations of the header; see below to select the most
appropriate one for your use case.

## Related components

The header is a layout that consists of navigation and dropdown components that are included
together. Button styles are also used for navigation dropdown styles in the header.

## Known issues

No known issues.

## Colors

The header comes in white or dark blue themes. Use the `header--white` and `header--blue`
classes.

<Story story={stories.colors} />

## Branding

The header can have either a simple text brand:

<Story story={stories.withTextBrand} />

Or it can use an image in lieu of text. Make sure the image has appropriate `alt` text:

<Story story={stories.withImageBrand} />

## Navigation

The header can contain navigation items. These can simple links. Use the `header--blue`
class in this case. On small screens, the navigation items are replaced by a button and
with a dropdown that shows the links. To see what this looks like, switch to the Canvas
tab and toggle the "hideMobileDropdown" switch on a mobile view:

<Story story={stories.withNavItems} />

Or they can be dropdown menus for more complex navigation. Use the `header--white`
class in this case:

<Story story={stories.withDropdownItems} />

## Social Media Icons

Social media icons can be added to a header as well.

<Story story={stories.withSocialIcons} />
