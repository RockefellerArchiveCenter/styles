# Pagination

Pagination allows you to divide large amounts of content into smaller chunks across multiple pages.

## When to use

Use pagination when there are too many results to show on one page, so the user
isn't overwhelmed by too much information.

Pagination is commonly used for things like table listings, search results, and
directories. What constitutes “too many results” can be influenced by:
- system load times
- amount of data in each entry
- screen space

Pagination is a control that sits at the bottom and top of the page and allows
the user to easily move between each page.

## Best practices

Clearly identify which page the user is on by displaying the current page number.
By providing context into how many pages there are in total (eg. 1 of 4 pages),
you can help provide clarity around the data displayed.

Use pagination instead of enabling infinite scrolling.
