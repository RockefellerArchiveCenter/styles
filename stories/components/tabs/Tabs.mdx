# Tabs

Navigate between related sections of content, displaying one section at a time.

## When to use

Tabs can be a helpful way of letting users quickly switch between related information if:

- your content can be usefully separated into clearly labeled sections
- the first section is more relevant than the others for most users
- users will not need to view all the sections at once

Tabs can work well for people who use a service regularly. Their need to perform tasks 
quickly may be greater than their need for simplicity of first-time use.

## Best practices

- Use an `href` attribute to ensure that the `id` of the tab is stored in the URL.
  This will allow the browsers's back button to work properly.
- Use clear labels to describe content so users will know if they need to click them.
- Order tabs according to user need, with the most commonly-used occuring first.
- Do not disable tabs. If there is no content for a tab, remove it or provide an 
  explanation as to why there is no content.
- Avoid tabs that wrap over more than one line.
- Add headings to tab content which duplicates information in the tab label.

## Known issues

Orange link color does not meet color contrast threshold.

## Basic implementation

Use JavaScript to show and hide tabs. To show a tab, add the `tabs__list-item--selected` class
to the relevant tabs list item, and add a `tabs__panel--hidden` class to all of the tab panels
that should be hidden.
