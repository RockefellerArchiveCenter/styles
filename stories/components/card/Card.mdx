# Card

Cards allow users to quickly browse content of varying types and lengths.

## When to use

Use to display heterogenous content composed of different elements, whose size or
supported actions vary. Allows a collection of multiple data types to be viewed
as a group so that a user can take some action relating to that group.

## Best practices

For accessibility, ensure that card content is placed in the correct reading order.

## Default implementation
The number of card columns can be specified in local CSS using media queries,
with the base styles providing one column that takes up the full width of its container.
For example, for 4 card columns on large screens and 3 columns on medium screens, use:
```
.card-list {
  @include md-up {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }

  @include lg-up {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  }
}
```

By default, cards have a body and a footer.

<Story of={stories.basic} />

However, the card footer is optional.

<Story of={stories.noFooter} />
