# Breadcrumbs

The breadcrumb is a secondary navigation pattern that helps a user understand the
hierarchy among levels and navigate back through them.

## When to use

Breadcrumbs are effective in products and experiences that have a large amount
of content organized in a hierarchy of more than two levels. They take up little
space but still provide context for the userâ€™s place in the navigation hierarchy.

Breadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace
the primary navigation. Do not use breadcrumbs on websites with a flat structure,
or to show progress through a linear journey or transaction.

## Best practices

The last item in a breadcrumb trail should indicate the current page using 
`aria-current="page"`, and should not be a link.

## Known issues

Color `$crusta-orange (#f16741)` on link hover/focus does not meet WCAG requirements for color 
contrast against most background colors.
