# Tooltips

Display a temporary, non-actionable help or confirmation message associated with a button or
other action element.

## When to use

Use the tooltip component when you want to temporarily display a brief help or confirmation
message that is associated with an element a user clicks, hovers or focuses on. Use tooltips 
to add supplemental information that is helpful for users, but is not required to operate 
the UI.

## Best practices

- Tooltips should be displayed for at least six seconds.
- Use the role='alert' attribute to support screen readers.
- Tooltips should not block a user from performing any other task on the screen.
- Do not include links or other interactive content in a tooltip.

## Known issues

No known issues.

## Basic implementation
Use javascript to show the tooltip when a user clicks, hovers or focuses 
on an element and to automatically hide it after a period of time.

Position the tooltip in relation to the element it describes using one of four classes:
1. `tooltip--top`
2. `tooltip--bottom`
3. `tooltip--left`
4. `tooltip--right`
