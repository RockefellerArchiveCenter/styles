# Tables

Display tabular data.

## When to use

Use this component when you have tabular data (data in rows and columns) and want to 
help users quickly and easily look up values.

Tables should not be used to control layout of a web page.

## Best practices

- Always use the base `table` class to improve the display of the table.

- Use the `table-striped` class if you want its row to have alternating background colors.

- When adding inputs in a table:
    - Each column needs a `th` tag with a unique ID attribute.
    - Each row needs a `th` tag with `scope="row"` and a unique ID attribute. This should ideally be a cell
      which describes the row, since that is the value screen readers will read.
    - Each field needs an aria-labelledby pointing to the IDs of the column and row header (separated by a space).
