# Alerts
Use a notification banner to tell the user about something they need to know about, 
but thatâ€™s not directly related to the page content.

## When to use

Use alerts to inform users of updates or changes to system status, or to acknowledge or 
confirm user actions. While alerts are an effective method of communicating with users, 
they are disruptive and should be used sparingly.

## Best practices

- Use the `role='alert'` attribute to support screen readers.
- Alerts should not block a user from performing any other task on the screen.
- Alerts should not disappear automatically. If you want users to be able to remove
  alerts, use the `alert--dismissable` class.
- Use the base `alert` class along with a color class that sets the background
  color of the alert.
- Do not use a notification banner to tell the user about validation errors - 
  use an error message and error summary instead
