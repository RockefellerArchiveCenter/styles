# Summary Lists

Summarize information as a list of key facts.

## When to use

Use a summary list to display metadata like ‘Last updated’ with a date like ‘22 June 2018’.

Do not use it for tabular data or a simple list of information or tasks, like a task list. 
For those use a `table`, `ul` or `ol`.

## Best practices

- The summary list uses the description list HTML element, so only use it to present information
  that has a key and at least one value.
- Do not use inputs in this component.
