# Footer

A footer provides information about the Rockefeller Archive Center and links to
key web pages.

## When to use

The footer should be used on all Rockefeller Archive Center web properties.

## Best practices

Determine if you need to add the secondary footer or not; for public-facing sites,
this is generally only relevant if the site uses archival data. For internal-only RAC
sites, you may use only the secondary footer.

To ensure that RAC Style Library styles apply to make the footer stay at the bottom of the page
regardless of page content height, the `<footer>` element myst be a direct child of the `<body>` element.
