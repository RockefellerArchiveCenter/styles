# Modal

Modals focus the user’s attention exclusively on one task or piece of information
via a window that sits on top of the page content.

## When to use

### Require an immediate response from the user
Use a dialog to request information that is preventing the system from continuing
a user-initiated process.

### Notify the user of urgent information
Use a modal dialog to notify the user of urgent information concerning their
current work. Modal dialogs are commonly used to report system errors or convey
a consequence of a user’s action.

### Confirm a user decision
Use a modal dialog to confirm user decisions. Clearly describe the action being
confirmed and explain any potential consequences that it may cause. Both the
title and the button should reflect the action that will occur. If the action is
destructive or irreversible then use a transactional danger modal.

## Best practices

- After the modal opens, initial focus should be set on the first focusable
  element in the modal.
- After a modal closes, focus should return to the element that invoked the modal.
- Focus must not move outside the modal until it is closed.
- The tab sequence of all modal dialogs should include a visible button that
  closes the dialog such as a close icon and/or cancel button.
- The escape key should also close the modal.
