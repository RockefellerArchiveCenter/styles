# Typography

## Fonts
We use two fonts on our websites for serif and sans serif text.

### Serif
**Font:** Manuale

**Weights:** 400(regular), 700(bold), 800(extrabold), 900(black)

<Typeset
  fontFamily={"Manuale"}
  fontWeight={400}
  fontSizes={[
    12, 14, 18, 24, 36, 72
  ]}
/>


### Sans-Serif
**Font:** Lato

**Weights:** 400(regular), 700(bold), 800(extrabold), 900(black)

<Typeset
  fontFamily={"Lato"}
  fontWeight={400}
  fontSizes={[
    12, 14, 18, 24, 36, 72
  ]}
/>

## Headings

Heading elements break up the content of the page into related sections of information to create
meaningful structure for page content, not just for visual style.

### Best practices

Use only one `h1` element per page, place heading in sequential order, and do not skip heading levels.

A bottom border can be added with the `heading--bottom-border` class.

### Known issues

There are currently only partially defined styles for `h5` and `h6`.

## Links
Links connect to URLS as from other web pages, files, email, or locations in the same page.

### Best practices

Link text should be descriptive of its target. For generic link text like "read more", use
`aria-labelledby` to link to associated titles or `aria-label` to provide more specific
descriptive text.

For a bolder link, use the `link--bold` class.

Links are underlined by default. Remove underlines by using the `link--no-underline` class
only if the context on the page indicates that the text is a link even without the
underline. For example, links in headings or a table of contents may not need underlines
if users can understand that they're links.

### Known issues

No known issues.
