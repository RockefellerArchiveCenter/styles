# Layout
Layout dictates how components appear on the page in relation to each
other, including on different devices and screen sizes.

## Usage
Use [CSS Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox),
[CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), and the `float` property as needed to
position components and set page areas. There are multiple page wrapper and layout helper classes to
facilitate layout:

- `container`: Sets a container elements with 15px margin gutters on either side of the
container with a width of 100% minus the gutters.
- `container--full-width`: Sets a container element to `width: 100%` with no gutters.
- `wrapper`: Creates a flexbox wrapper (`display: flex`) that centers the content inside
with  `justify-content: center;`
- `flex`: Simply adds `display: flex` to an element.
- `grid`: Creates a CSS Grid container with 12 columns that fill the container by applying
  the styles `display: grid` and `grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr)` to the element.

## Best practices

Design for a responsive layout by initially creating styles for small screens using a single-column
layout. Then, enhance using media queries as needed to adjust for medium screens and
large screens. You can add the SCSS mixins for media queries in local
site styles along with the screen size breakpoint variables:
```
// Breakpoints map
$break-md: 580px;
$break-lg: 1024px;

@mixin md-up {
  @media screen and (min-width: $break-md) { @content; }
}

@mixin lg-up {
  @media screen and (min-width: $break-lg) { @content; }
}
```
There is no default maximum width set in the styles, but for sites that require a
maximum width, use `max-width: 1440px`.

## Known issues
There are no known issues.

## Implementing a 12-column grid
Apply the `grid` class to a container to define 12 columns on the page, and then
specify which/how many columns each child element should span using the `grid-column`
property.
