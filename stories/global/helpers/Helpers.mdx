# Helper Classes
The RAC Style Library includes CSS classes that are available to style elements and
components as needed to allow for flexibility.

## When to use
- `list--unstyled`: Use to remove the default bullets and left indent from an
unordered list.
- `visually--hidden`: Hide an element visually while still being available for screen
readers.
- `show-on-focus`: When an element receives focus, it will appear visually. This can be
combined with the `visually-hidden` class.
- `hide-on-lg-up`, `show-on-lg-up` `hide-on-md-up`, `show-on-md-up`: Hide or show
elements only when the screen display size is large or medium. When items are hidden,
they will have `display:none;` applied, which hides them both visually and from
screen readers.

## Best practices
Use `visually--hidden` in targeted circumstances to improve accessibility,
but note that it is almost always better not to hide content from some users and make
it available to other users, so consider design approaches that don't require this.

Use `show-on-focus` sparingly. It is usually best for usability and accessibility not
to hide elements and surprise users with new content only when an element receives focus.

## Related components
